README by Jeppa:
This version was fixed by Jeppa to have safe maps (block-protection)
and more than one spawnpoint (one spawnpoint per arena!)
You may have to edit the config.yml! 
The worlds order is the corresponding worlds-number !!!
First world ist world #1 etc...
The worlds/arenas numbers should start with #1 and count up...
There are default-values for arenas in the configfile 
so you will see up to 20 arenas after first spawns set.
This is just done to avoid some bugs if arenas are not in a row starting by 1 :/
You may have arena numbers like 2,4,6 with this, 
but still should count them like 1,2,3,4... !!!
With this in your mind: don't have arena-numbers bigger
than 20 until you realy have that amount!
